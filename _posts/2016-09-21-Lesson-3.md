  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by expanding on what the Fuze booklet said and edited it to make it my own. This helped me to learn the code rather than just copy it out of the book.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on trying to be more creative in the way I complete the tasks. For example, keeping the same principle of what the task is but maybe changing the actual text or variable name.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will first read what the task and then discuss with my partner how we can change it to make slightly more challenging and personal.</td>
