This week we had our lesson in IT2, the Apple Mac room. We continued with our micro bit tutorials. We also found out that when we complete the 9 tutorials, we would be creating our own games. This was very exciting because it we could now use our knowledge of Code Kingdoms and be creative to make a game that we want to use.
