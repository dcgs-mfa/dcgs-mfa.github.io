This week we started the lesson by watching the 'Sorting Hat' scene from Harry Potter and the Philosopherâ€™s Stone. At first this was confusing because we had been looking at how to code micro:bits recently but all became clear when we found out we would be making an app for our micro:bits which would randomly pick a house out of: -Gryffindor

                                                                                     -Slytherin

                                                                                     -Hufflepuff

                                                                                     -Ravenclaw

Our challenge was then to change the way the app was triggered (button[A] to on [shake]) and then to make the app for our own houses (Foxell, Holman, Newman, Pearson, Rayner, Thorne). 

This app however was coded in Microsoft 'Touch Develop' but our last task of the lesson was to recode the app without any guidance in Java script.
