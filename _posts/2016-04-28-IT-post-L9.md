This week we were told that hopefully, within the next few weeks, our BBC micro:bits would be arriving. This was very exciting news as the BBC micro:bits are used to learn how to code. The concept is simple: you code a program and the BBC micro:bit shows you what happens when you run that program.

This is what a BBC micro:bit looks like:

This week, we spent our lesson practising how to code the micro:bits even though they haven't arrived yet. The point of the lesson was to become familiar with the software and coding languages you can use.
