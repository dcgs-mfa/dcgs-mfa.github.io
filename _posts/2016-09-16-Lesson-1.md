    <td>Myself and my partner had difficulties with our HDMI to VGA cable but after thinking hard about what the problem could be we tried on different monitor. This also didn't work and so we asked one of IT technicians for help. It turns out that we had a faulty cable and so when trying with another cable we had success. The most important strategy this lesson was trial and error; perseverance to find the right answer.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think the biggest limitation on my learning in the lesson was speed. I spent too much time looking at what the problem was rather than attempting to fix it. I need to know when to move on and try rather than think.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will be aware of how much time I take on something and make sure that I feel confident to move on. I will try to concentrate on the work given and make progress as fast as I can.</td>
