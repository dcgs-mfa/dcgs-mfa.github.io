After looking at our blogs at the start of the lesson, we jumped straight into coding our games. I learnt that CK, being such a simple interface, did not like it when I tried to set the variables for my actions as Boolean expressions and Mr. Keen told me to set it as a numerical value. This week we were to continue to code our game for homework.
