After last week's challenging task to create our own computer programme we did a slightly easier task this week. We followed some instructions on how to make a programme for our micro:bits. We started off with a simple dice programme and then went on to some more challenging tasks.

For each programme, there was an extension task and these were slightly more challenging. Our homework was to go home and spend Â½ hour working our way through the different programme instructions.
