After completing the last Code Kingdoms tutorials for homework, we moved onto MAKING OUR OWN GAMES!!! We started off the lesson by returning to our planning documents to present them in a more exciting and easy to read way. We then went onto organising our Google Drive folders; as it's nearing the end of the year Mr Keen advised that we organise our year’s work into different folders in our Google Drive. I learnt that this is a really effective way of finding certain pieces of work easily. I also learnt how to move files around in Google Drive.

As homework this week, I will be doing ½ an hour of microbit coding to make way into completing my micro:bit games. My game is called "Shake it" and it has the same principle of “Bob it” but for micro:bit.
