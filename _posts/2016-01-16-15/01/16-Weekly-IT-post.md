In class this week, we were talking and learning about media and media literacy. This included working out what media actually is and the different elements of media. We were talking about the meaning of text and subtext and how the text is what the media actually tells you and the subtext is the message behind the text. Our example was the 'Kia Soul Ad.' which is linked below.

I found another ad that demonstrates text and subtext which is also linked below

Assignment: Select a media example. This could be a commercial, billboard, radio ad, or magazine ad. 

Answer the questions below:

Name of media example you deconstructed: Sainsbury's Christmas Ad. 2014  

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Who is the target audience in this media example? (Be specific)</td>
    <td>What is the subtext (hidden or underlying message) in this media example?</td>
    <td>What are the untold stories
(what information is left out of
the message)?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The target audience of this advert is very broad, age wise, but it is mostly aimed at shoppers tempting them to go to Sainsbury's. It’s aimed at children to pester their parents to go to Sainsbury’s and at adults to make them think that Sainsbury’s is a great place to shop.</td>
    <td>Sainsbury’s are saying, ’We have something for everyone, even your enemies. We’ll help you get the right thing for any situation. Get happiness even from the people you’re supposed to hate at special times during the year such as Christmas. Christmas is for sharing.’</td>
    <td>Britain and Germany were at war but even through the hate and destruction, they found time to share Christmas.</td>
