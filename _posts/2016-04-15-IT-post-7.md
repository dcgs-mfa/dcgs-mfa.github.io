This week, we moved on from our Media Navigator topic and are now focusing on presenting. We created an account on Prezi, a free presentation software which focuses more on visuals to aid the text rather than just slide after slide of long, boring information. Prezi has its own unique way of changing between slides; it pans, rotates and zooms rather than just appearing at the next slide with more text. 

There are so many features in Prezi that our homework was to go home and 'play' with the software.
