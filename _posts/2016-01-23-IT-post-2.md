This week in class, we were analysing some more ads. but this time looking at what was reality and what was fantasy. 

We were talking about reality and fantasy in our real lives and completed one task which involved deciding how much we agree with statements concerning situations that typical teenagers might be in and discussed whether we regretted anything we have posted online and whether social media affects our friendships at all.

I think the most interesting conversation was about reality tv shows and how normally people acted on camera. I. I thought it was fascinating at how large the range of opinions were. 

Our homework this week was to go home and find another advert to deconstruct but this time, find what was fantasy and reality. 

I chose the Amazon Fire TV stick ad as I think this is a great example of fantasy and reality.
