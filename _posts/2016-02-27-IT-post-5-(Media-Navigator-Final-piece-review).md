This week in class we had a very different lesson. We were reviewing our Identity Maps which we completed of our half term holiday. In this blog, I'll be reviewing not only my identity map, but the whole of our media navigator topic.

It was quite difficult creating my identity map as I was not sure how the information I included would be interpreted. Although I was unsure about how my classmates would understand the info I put on my identity map, I actually felt comfortable with sharing it with the class the way we did. I felt less uncomfortable with commenting on other people's work as it was clear that some people had done the wrong thing altogether. It was difficult to give constructive feedback without being critical. I therefore would have preferred to talk to the person face to face and ask how certain things should be interpreted and give them feedback based on their reactions. When I came back to my work and read through the comments, I wasn’t that surprised that people advised that I include more writing. Also, it felt good reading through the appraisals. This is different to commenting online as you are more aware of how the person will react to your comments if you are in the room with them. After looking at the comments, I feel much more confident on how people will interpret what I post on social media and it has definitely shaped how much or little I share. 

The conversations we've had over the past 6 lessons were very informative and made me much more aware of not only the dangers but of the benefits and downsides of social media. It has also made me really think about how I want to be displayed on social media. It has also changed my views on my usage of social media in the future. For example it’s benefits for business as well as social.
