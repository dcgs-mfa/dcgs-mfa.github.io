This week in class we worked even more on our micro:bits and came across our biggest challenge yet: to introduce a best of 3 scoring system in our flashpoint game.

It was really difficult because first we had to make the game score and then make it count the score throughout the 3 games.

I learnt how to use while loops and how they repeat a chunk of code forever whilst a certain factor is true.
