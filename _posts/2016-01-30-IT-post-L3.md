This week in class, social media was the main point of conversation. We were talking mostly about the advantages and disadvantages of social media and also the dangers of posting online. It really made me realise how harming the tiniest of mistakes can be and that life can be turned completely turned upside-down just by posting something even to just your friends.

One exercise involved getting into groups and ordering situations from worst to least harming. I was personally amazed at the range of ideas and the reactions of people when they were helped understand the possible consequences of posts on social media. 

Our homework was to write about how we hope social media will shape our careers in the future.
