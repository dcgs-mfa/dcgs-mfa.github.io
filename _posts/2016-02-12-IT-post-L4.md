This week in class we were talking about the dangers on social media sites. Our main activity was to come up with guidelines for people using social media and how to be safe but still find social media fun and beneficial. Our discussions included talking about how social media can greatly help our lives.

Our homework was then to go home and actually interview someone who we know who uses social media and talk about their identity on social media and how they would be judged solely on their social media profile.
