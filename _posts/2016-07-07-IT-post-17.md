We have now moved on from our micro:bit coding topic and for the remainder of the year, we will be looking at the dangers of the Internet. We started off by brainstorming ideas for what the Internet is most used for. We came up with a very long list of uses and I was surprised at how much the Internet is used for. 

After this we discussed some of the bad uses of the Internet and we talked particularly about 'Pornography' and ‘Sexting.’ Our Homework was to look on the Internet for news articles about these two titles.
