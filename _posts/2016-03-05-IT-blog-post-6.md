We had a very interesting lesson this week. Instead of being of talking about decisions  we would make in certain situations, we watched the CEOP 'First to a million' series and made our own decisions as we went through them. The video is linked below:

As we went through the videos, I found it really interesting how there was such range of reasons for why people chose what they did. The videos really helped me understand how just a small competition for likes on YouTube can lead to huge problems which could even get the police involved. I was surprised that people of college age can get lost in social media just as much as people in mid-secondary school.
